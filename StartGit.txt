Open your browser and go to https://git-scm.com/downloads and download Git for your operating system

Create a new repository by browsing to the folder on your computer that you'd like to work under. From this folder, run the command: git init

Open your browser and go to https://github.com/ and sign up for a Github account

On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository you are interested in using. Note that when you create a repository on GitHub, it is a remote repository. We will clone a repository to create a local copy on your computer and we can then sync between the two locations when needed. Hence, we will have a local copy of the repository and a remote copy of the repository.

Under the repository name on Github, click clone or download

In the Clone with HTTPS section, copy the clone URL link

Open your command line and navigate to the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made. Type and run the command: git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY (paste the link that you copied before).
